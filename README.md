# Word-Finder-Gamer

The program is a single-player word game, where the user enters as many words as they are able to think of using a selection of 9 letters. The user can play the game in “easy mode” or “hard mode”.
The program first selects 9 letters of the alphabet at random. The same letter can appear multiple times, and the selection process uses the frequency of letters in the game of Scrabble when choosing letters, so that the 9 letters chosen are more likely to contain letters that are common in English words, e.g. the letters are much more likely to contain “E”, “I” or “A” than “Z”, “Q” or “X”.
